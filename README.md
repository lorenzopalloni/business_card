# Hackaday 2024 Business Card Contest
In my journey of learning Electronics and PCB design, and with the philosophy "fail fast, fail often" in mind, I wanted to challenge myself with the 2024 Business Card Contest. I created a very simple business card with a couple of LEDs whose blinking frequency can be adjusted by a trimmer.

I used KiCad 8.0.

Among others, I want to thank Shawn Hymel, Philip Salmony (Phil's Lab), and Charles Platt, from whom I have learnt a ton.
