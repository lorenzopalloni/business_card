# Hackaday 2024 Business Card Contest
In my journey of learning Electronics and PCB design, and with the philosophy "fail fast, fail often" in mind, I wanted to challenge myself with the 2024 Business Card Contest. I created a very simple business card with a couple of LEDs whose blinking frequency can be adjusted by a trimmer. I am not even sure if it is working properly, but I will spend more time on it because I would like to order a physical version. I also have some ideas for a completely new version for the next year.

I used KiCad 8.0.
