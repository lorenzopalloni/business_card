# Naive Business Card
In my journey of learning Electronics and PCB design, and with the philosophy "fail fast, fail often" in mind, I wanted to challenge myself with the [Hackaday 2024 Business Card Contest](https://hackaday.io/contest/195949-2024-business-card-contest). I created a very simple business card with a couple of LEDs whose blinking frequency can be adjusted by a trimmer.

I used KiCad 8.0.

## Acknowledgement
Among others, I want to thank Shawn Hymel, Philip Salmony (Phil's Lab), and Charles Platt, from whom I have learnt a ton.
